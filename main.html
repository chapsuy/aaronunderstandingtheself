                <p>I resonate with Locke's idea that we are the sum of our experiences and it matches perfectly with my Christmas memories. These moments became part of my identity, showing me the value of love, connection, and joy to my family.</p>

               <p> Senior high school graduation was a moment of triumph, symbolizing years of effort and perseverance. 
                It felt like a stepping stone toward adulthood and I felt like at that time, I'm kinda scared since reality of life is really near for me to experience and maybe I'am also near at my brighter future.</p><br>
                <p>  I also realized that facing the unknown is part of growing and reaching a brighter future and Marcus Aurelus idea  of facing lifeâ€™s challenges with courage matches my experience.

At first, I thought that all it matters is how you cared for each other but I realized that it's more than that and so many factors to consider. It taught me the importance of mutual respect, trust, and especially effective   communication and understanding each other. Without it, it'll be hard for a relationship to last long.

             <p>In Aristotleâ€™s view of relationships, it's being built on respect, balance, and virtue . The lessons Iâ€™ve learned about communication and emotional support align with his idea of how to create and maintain meaningful relationships.</p>

                 <p> When I was at my senior high school year. I've tried to work so that I can pay for my expenses at school and I don't want to depend at my parents anymore. I've tried to be a helper to a meat shop and that's when the realization hits me on how hard to work just to earn that kind of money. I imagine whenever a person is working in a low minimum wage, it's hard survive on your own with that little amount of money. This became an eye opener for me. Working, really demands a lot of discipline, focus and time management.</p>
                 <p>There's a philosopher that I think that I resonate with his idea and that was Nietzscheâ€™s idea about growth comes from overcoming challenges. Working hard and facing those difficulties taught me how to develop inner strength and discipline, which are essential for personal growth.</p>

    <div class="descript">
      
        <p> The illustration I drew is of a human from a famous myth called "The Myth of Icarus". It's about a man whose ambition led him to push his limits too far, ultimately causing his demise. The story of Icarus resonates with me deeply. 
<br><br>
When I was working at home, I had to do all the chores by myself. I pushed myself to finish everything as fast as I could without taking a break. Eventually, I got sick and experienced difficulty breathing for an entire month. Every day felt like torture, even though I was taking medication. During that time, I realized that if I hadn't pushed myself too hard, I could have avoided getting sick and would have been able to do more than just lie in bed. 
<br><br>
This experience taught me that I shouldn't push myself beyond my limits to achieve something that isn't more precious than my health. Now, I understand the importance of knowing my limits and taking breaks when needed and need to listen to my body as well.    </p>
